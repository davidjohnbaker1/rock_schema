List of Schemas

* Network is unidirectional
* 10 and 3 would be indicitive of minor pentatonic space

==Critique==

*Significance is that if we can find significantly used schemas
*Everything has a place in the theory 
*Application is in identifying counterintuitive examples of the schema
*Explaining the 
*It attempts to take out the white noice
	V chord has intrinsic function
	If you have to make claim for repitoire
	Need to separate schematic positional stuff from the way that it actually behaves
	Once we finish this, essentially are eliminating no
	Doesn't matter end listeneing experiences, better described with labled network
	Pretend for sake of this experiment that chords don't have botton up function 
	Especially approrpriate because we have these modal things
	More stright forward in classical music, position finding is more straight forward
	It's harder to position find in something like night moves 
	Pretending that ears don't have to position find 

Just like identifiying the schema in classical music, we are identifying ht compositional logic
behind picking those chords
In classical music, that's all were trying to desribe, the 'logic' of the chord progressions
Trying to talk about things based on Roman Numerals is not needed
The logic comes from the network approach rather than the chords position in the scale 
Pretend for a minute that we should ignore those funcitn
	they MIGHT exist , function as category still possible, 

Function is overdetermined, all we are looking for is the reason taht one chord went to another
we can give top down or bottom up 
Let's ignore bottom up for hte purposes of this study
IF after stripping away the top down, there is still strong evidence of bottom up, then it's the only optino left over

For a full functional circut it needs to be over 2 chords 
	So vamp of I IV I IV will not work, trivial, get ignored 
	Needs to have 3 or 4 chords, intervals sum to multiple of 12 
	We replace Nobiles functional circut with sequence of 3 or more chords
	Funtion isn't a thing until 3 sonorities are introduced???

Our functional circuts are based around the temperly declerque model 
We take that as a starting point

If you are looking at only terms of scale degree motion, IV V I outnumbers V IV I (retrogression)
BUT If you consider bVII IV I to be the same thing as V IV I, then our 3 gram outnumbers the progressive version (which is in accordance with the stephenson idea that we have retrogressive) by a significant **** portion. 

It's musically intuitite, guitar composers go up all the way more than they go around the fretboard

Problem: bVI bVII I is clealry different than from I ii iii, but they would show up the same in our theory. 
It's the performacne, not the recording.
At that point its the kinesthetic engagement with the instrument.

We don't care if the two or three grams are vampable bc they dont exist in %12 

Repititions of the same chord if it's not based on hypermeter, then why would we consider
repititons of same chord to be a transition at all.

Maybe Blues/Double Plagal is just a three gram becaues it repeats the I chord.
V VI I I, musically is 4, our theory is just a 3 gram

Can get around blues and double plagal as same thing, chord reps get cancelled out


They're essentially coronas of the 4gram network.
They're way's of getting around rather than a full cycle.

*This is entirely top down way of thinking
*Schematic approach to this

House of Rising Sun and After midnight are same 2 gram
	3 - 2 :|
	Rising Sun uses minor i 
	After Midnight uses Major I
	This is an example how our system gets around the problem of modal mixture

==Double Plagal==
Double Plagal, Nicole Biamonte, 2010, Sympathy for the Devil
Double Plagal, Nicole Biamonte, 2010, Night Moves, Bob Seger
Prototype
	In C: C | Bb | F | C :| 
	* Any rotations of that we would consider to be equivilent 
	Notation: 10 | 7 | 7 | 0 :| 
	Normal: 0 | 10 | 7 | 7 :|
	* Any rotation of that would be considered to be a double plagal network
--Subset network for the blues cadence
Night Moves - Bob Seger 
==Blues Cadence==
Includes 2-Gram Subset
	In C: C | Bb | F | F :|
	* Just changing last chord to F changes 2 intervals, enter and exit
	Notation: 10 | 7 | 0 | 7 :|
Adding up to any multiple of 12 means that the four chord progression can be vampable
	There can not be a 3-gram subset of a 4-gram if both are vampable, they add to same amount
	if one is different, the other can't add back up to %12
Focus on four chords in a row that are capable of being turned into a vamp?
** Any blues tune / Sweet Home Alabama **
!! Rotation of I IV V I 

** Should pick a normal form of this, set it up as prime form of a set
** As compact to the left as possible

	Notation: 9 | 8 | 2 | 5 :|
Vampable 

==Sensitive Female Cadence==
