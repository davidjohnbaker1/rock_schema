In Conversion Process

Need to get rid of extensions and any sort of other chord information besides Chord, root, inversion quality

a for augmented needs to be switched to 
a has to be a + 
d7 should just be removed , also d9 
viio7 should be for h7 
viioD7 for x7 
s for suspensions should be removed and anything behind it
Other symbols!? V11 means IV over 5?
