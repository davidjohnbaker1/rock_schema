# Converter Workflow  

## Data Cleaning

* [X] Convert .txt file to kern file that Humdrum can analyze
* [X] Retain original Columns for analysis sake 
* [X] Add Root Column
* [ ] Ideally put in Metadata from file (Craig Sapp Perl Script Can Do This)
* [X] Save in sister directory 

## Data Cleaning More Notes

* The harm folders are the TDC Corpus before making humdrum syntax aka kern
* Ran a loop with ./converter.sh script
* Then renamed and put in harm

----------------------
## Analysis

* [ ] Add Column that is only melody of the root
* [ ] Translate each root motion to descending semi-tone
* [ ] Refer to original markdown on what sets of context to run
